# Quiz API

This project was created as the final project of the year at [`ALX`](https://tech.alxafrica.com/) SE program.

## Project Overview
The Quiz API is a robust and scalable solution for creating and managing quizzes and user attempts. It allows users to:

- Create and categorize quizzes.
- Attempt quizzes with different question types.
- View their attempt history and scores.
- Manage authentication and user access.

The API is hosted on Railway and available at the base URL:
**`https://quizapi.up.railway.app/v1`**.

This API supports a variety of question types, including:
- Multiple Choice
- True/False
- Matching Pairs
- Ordering Items
